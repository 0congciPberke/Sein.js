Java decompilation is a process that takes the compiled bytecode of a Java program and translates it back into its original source code[^5^]. In other words, it takes a compiled Java program and makes it human readable again. The decompiler will first look for patterns in the bytecode and use them to reconstruct the code from the compiled program.
 
Java decompilation can be useful for various purposes, such as debugging, reverse engineering, learning, or modifying Java applications. However, Java decompilation also has some limitations and challenges. For example, some information may be lost during the compilation process, such as comments, variable names, or formatting. Also, some bytecode may be obfuscated or encrypted to prevent decompilation or make it harder to understand.
 
There are different tools and techniques for Java decompilation. Some of them are open source and free, while others are commercial and proprietary. Some of them are standalone applications, while others are plugins or integrations for IDEs. Some of them support modern Java features and versions, while others are outdated or incomplete. Some of them are fast and accurate, while others are slow and erroneous.
 
Some of the most popular and widely used Java decompilers are: Procyon[^1^], CFR[^1^], JD[^1^], Fernflower[^1^], Krakatau[^5^], and JAD[^2^]. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the use case and preference of the user. For example, Procyon and CFR are able to handle Java 8 features such as lambdas and method references, while JAD is very fast but only supports Java 1.3.
